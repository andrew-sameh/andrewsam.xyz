## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Andrew Sameh

I'm a Software Engineer <Twemoji emoji="laptop" /> based in Egypt. With a knack for AI and web development, I love crafting innovative solutions that boost efficiency and performance. My tech journey has me building AI-driven applications, microservices, and full-stack solutions that push the envelope of possibility. My academic adventure includes a Bachelor's degree <Twemoji emoji="grad" /> in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

Right now, I work remotely <Twemoji emoji="world" /> for Valsoft - Aspire Software in Canada. I'm all about integrating cool AI features and developing solid backend systems. Whether it's writing code or collaborating with cross-functional teams, I ensure our products meet top standards and wow our users.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me grooving to my favorite music <Twemoji emoji="headphones" /> or watching movies <Twemoji emoji="movie" /> These hobbies keep my creativity flowing and my mind fresh.

🤖 I'm currently diving deep into AI concepts, mastering GoLang, and exploring the Fiber framework. Continuous learning is my jam, and I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing in tech.
